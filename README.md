# Stock-Trading-Management-Database-Application

This project involves building a stock trading management database application using a web front-end. The
app is designed to allow a user to view and manage various trades. The user can view the stocks theyâ€™re
holding and view their net loss/profit. The user can also connect the app to their bank accounts to view
their balances and see how much they can afford to invest. Because businesses might have certain rules
about which stocks their employees can trade, a user can provide the business they work for. The user can
also specify their region to know more about the user and account for certain stocks that may be exclusive
to people in certain regions. The database also creates a record of all transactions a user makes that
includes the user, stock, number of shares, date, and platform they used to buy the stock. Users can create
and manage their portfolio as well as view general data within our database to make more informed
trading decisions.

In this repository, the database desgin can be viewed in the `schema.sql` file and the front-end can be viewed in the
`project.py` file. Sample data was provided in the `/data` folder that populates the tables to make it easier
to test the application.
